# CampusConnect
This is a university seeking application I made to improve my android programming skills.
It uses:
* Android Room to manage a local SQLite database
* RecyclerView to show results
* Fragments to be more responsive (it has a tablet mode)
* Custom adapters
* DataBinding to simplify things!
* And more

I learned a lot on this project, and it's not perfect, but as I used to say, it seems to work!
